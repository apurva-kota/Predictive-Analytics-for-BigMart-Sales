# Predictive-Analytics-for-BigMart-Sales

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to forecast sales for various products across multiple BigMart outlets. The key challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict future sales based on historical data, enabling better inventory management, demand forecasting, and strategic decision-making for BigMart.

## Solution
A machine learning model was developed to predict future sales of products using historical sales data from BigMart outlets. This model can help optimize inventory management and improve demand forecasting. Various regression techniques, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, were employed to estimate sales accurately.

## How I Approached It
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Used **Pandas** for data manipulation, cleaning, and preprocessing.
   - **NumPy** was employed for numerical operations, ensuring efficient data handling.
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted with **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize sales trends and relationships between product attributes.
   
2. **Model Building:**
   - Implemented multiple regression models using **Scikit-learn**, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict sales.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed to improve model accuracy.

3. **Model Evaluation:** 
   - Evaluated model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to assess prediction accuracy.

## What I Found
- **Key Influences:** Factors such as product visibility, product type, and store size significantly impacted sales predictions.
- **Model Performance:** Random Forest outperformed other models, delivering better accuracy and lower error rates.
- **Insights:** High-selling products and outlets with better visibility and higher footfall were easier to predict accurately, highlighting the importance of data granularity.

## Conclusion
The predictive analytics model successfully forecasts future sales across BigMart outlets, providing valuable insights for inventory management and demand planning. By utilizing historical sales data, the project demonstrated how machine learning can be leveraged to support business strategies, ultimately helping improve operational efficiency.
